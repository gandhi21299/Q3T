i'm calling an line (horiontal/vertical/diagonal) of marks as  krist
Observations:
	requires maximum n sqaured moves to complete a cycle
	because of the qunatum nature of game forming an n length krist is tough (therefore points for such krist should be high)
	while calculating the sub-points be careful that the same krist is not calculated twice

Introducing concept of prime cells
	prime cells are cells which are only used in one particular krist
	more the prime cells, more marks will be awarded.
	In case of a n board, if no is able to make n length krist, pointing system will consider the length of the biggest krist formed, say m and the krist of (m-1), provided m > 3. any krist of length less than m-1 will be rendered unimportant, this will provide two stratgies two play a game,
		1. Trying to make as long a krist as possible 
		2. Trying to keep m as small as possible and make as much small krist as you can
	if a krist of length m-1 is included within a krist of length m, then that particular krist shall be ignored.
	If the number of m-length krist is odd, the player who made more m-length krist is declared winner/or an alternative is to not do so and consider both m and m-1 length krist , where each m length krist will give you m points and each m-1 length krist will give [m/2], thus making each m length krist equal to two m-1 length krist. (a dynamic approach where instead of 2, points can be calculated according to some other property of the game, thus making the point system varying with each game, (say x, where x = number of m length krist made in the game)).
	For each prime cell, m/x points shall be awarded.
	a prime cell in p-length krist will have [p/q] (q = number of p length krist) 
	when considering prime cells only valid m and m-1 length krists are to be considered.
Therefore point of a player will be
	m*(number of m-length krist) + [m/(2 or x)]*(number of m-1 length krist) + prime cells points.
	The player with higher points win.
